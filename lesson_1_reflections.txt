	How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
file compare is useful for taking you directly to file changes as opposed to looking through complete code and searching manually.It is time efficient.
	How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term? 
make you more reliable because you know the best ways to find bugs and eliminate them.If a file needs to revert back to something it had implemented before you know what steps to take to accomplish that as well.
	What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,like you do in Git,vs having versions automatically saved,like Google docs does?
Pros:using ones thought process to make logical decisons on when to commit to streamline the process and have short consice commits that are to the point and efficient.
Cons:sometimes one may not kno when it is a good time to creta a commit.Waiting too long to create a commit will result in a log thats too long and cluttered which would lead to inefficiency.
	Why do you think some version control systems,like Git,allow saving multiple files in one commit,while others,like Google Docs,treat each file seperately?
because git is more code related for programmers and apps such as google docs is a more general documenting format.
	How can you use the commands git log and get diff to view the history of files?
you can use git log to find the file your looking for and git diff to compare it to a previous file to note changes made.
	How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
because with git you kno you will always have files to reference in case you make a mistake you can always get to where it is and fix it so.
	Now that you have your wokspaceset up,what do you want to try using Git for?
using it to saves different versions of code as commits and to help debugging.
