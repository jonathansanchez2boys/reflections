	When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you want help or are not at home to access your computer files.
	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?
because github and git cant tell when its a logical enough changes to pull.this is up to the user and to the users liking and needs.
