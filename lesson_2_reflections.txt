	What happens when you intialize a repository?Why do you need to do it?
you create a folder containing all the history of that or those files to be viewed and edited.Ease of use.
	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?What value do you think it offers?
the working directory are where the files are located.The repository is then created to take what files you want if any or all from the working directory and links them and keeps track of them with commits.the staging are is the area you use to decide what files and how you want to add them to the repository for track keeping.It adds value cuz instead of adding all files from directory into 1 commit it lets the user decide what files and when to commit from the working directory.
